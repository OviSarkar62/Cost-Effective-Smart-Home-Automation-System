# Cost-Effective-Smart-Home-Automation-System


Summary: This project presents a cost effective smart home automation system. The earlier version of home automation system used in the developed countries is very costly and complex for the users. Now a days, with the rapid growth of technologies in the developing countries, a smart home automation system is being adopted in many places. The developed system is very easy to operate by using smartphone and it is especially recommended for its low installation and maintenance cost. The whole system has been developed by using Bluetooth technology and smartphone application with indispensable hardware connections like Arduino, relay switching circuits etc.

Apparatus: 
– Arduino UNO 
– Relay module
– HC 05 Wireless Bluetooth Module
– Bulb
– Resistors(2.2k ohm, 1k ohm)
– Jumper wires
